Bot will See will know where to go and what to avoid .<br>\nPotential risks and obstacles.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Case it is a patent design which is a big possibility . the design Rights will be given to the One who has already designed this Bot. And the ownership of this design will be the right of the Patent Holder.</li>\n<li>Useage risks . Every human has a unique behavior , in that case the setting of this WalkerBot can not be generalised , explicit settings will be required for each individual , in specific a child with cerebral Palsy(condition)</li>\n<li>Fire Hazards. strong sensor fusion to monitor temperatures on all heat generating units With cut off system.</li>\n<li>claims by users in case of an accident : : It is open source and</li>\n<li>Financial Obstacles.  Funding can be a big issue , but for prototyping<br>\nor making the first model , some compromise on the looks and the beauty of the Bot may be compromised by using Available crafted parts instead of Pro designed 3D printed Parts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>How To Receive Resume Credit</h1>\n<p>If you see a Bee Hive , it is made up in hexagon.cells which are hexagonally places around each other . and if you consider any hole as a center, the entire Bee Hive revolves around that very center. you may select any cell<br>\nbut yet the entire Beehive will be around that.<br>\nEach member of this team<br>\nwill be like the center of the team and around him will the team revolve<br>\nwhen that very member will be active with his inputs.<br>\nthis is not   MY   project , this is   OUR   project and the ownership goes to the children Who will walk with this .
