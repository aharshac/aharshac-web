# What is a Contribution?

**A Collaborizm Contribution is a peer to peer review written by another user in the community testifying to a specific piece of help or effort you made to another project or person.**

## For Example

I personally helped @[John Rodrigues](4JqFRBfbW) with the circuit design task on his Project. When John saw this effort, he awarded me a Contribution, which you can see on my profile. Essentially, it's a way to say thanks, and give credit to users for helping you in a meaningful way.
# How to Award a Contribution

Click the award contribution button on the bottom middle of any discussion. It's easy. Make sure to give credit where credit is due.

# Why Contributions are Gold

‚û°Ô∏è Contributions help generate your real life Resume! (These peer to peer reviews form credible additions to your resume, cv, and project portfolio).

‚û°Ô∏è Contributions users earn are a critical factor for the Collaborizm team when evaluating candidates for the @[üí∏ The Collaborizm Innovator Fund üí∏](project/r1XLW_zce). (The Collaborizm team always gives priority to top contributors.)

# The Contribution Showcase

An awesome feature on Collaborizm is the [Contribution Showcase](/showcase). This is an updated stream of all contributions awarded in the community.

So start contributing and building your documented resume! üí° üèÜ
