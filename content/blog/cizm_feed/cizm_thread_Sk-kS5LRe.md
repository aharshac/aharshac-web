I've made a React component to render dates and times in relation to the current time, like "x seconds/minutes/hours/days/years ago". 

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/react-relative-time.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/react-relative-time/)

This component does not depend on the ubiquitous [**moment.js**](https://momentjs.com/), which is close to 64 KB with locales. So I could limit the size to 5 KB by transpiling and minifying with **Babel** and  **Babili** respectively.

Thanks to @[Robert Lancer](21339) for asking me to make this package and push it to the **npm** registry. :)
