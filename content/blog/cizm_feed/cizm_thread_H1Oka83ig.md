I have a 220V AC to 5V 2A DC wall adapter which I use with my Raspberry Pi. It was working really well but is having problems now. The output now varies from 4.3V to 4.8V and hence the lights on the Pi blink, but it doesn't start. Even Android phones don't detect the output.

I think this is due to a blown capacitor, but I'm not sure. 

What might be the issue?

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you. :)

The Raspberry Pi is working fine. I want to know if and how the wall adapter could be repaired.
