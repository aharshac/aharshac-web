The **[Boston Tea Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party)** and Gandhi's **Salt March** ([1](http://www.history.com/news/gandhis-salt-march-85-years-ago), [2](http://www.dandimemorial.in/)) have taught us not to pay overpriced and sometimes unjustified taxes and duties. This is a small guide for buying stuff from the **People's Republic of China (PRC)**, not the **Republic of China (Taiwan)**.

Don't buy locally from importers who don't provide legal invoices. They are actually buying stuff in small quantities from the above-mentioned sites without paying duties, yet charge you exorbitant profit margins. They're cheating you as well as your country's government. Also, they will not cover warranties.

&nbsp;

## Context
* This guide is valid across the **Indian subcontinent (South Asia), i.e., India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan**.
* Not valid for countries like **Brazil, Russia, etc.** where the **Customs** departments are more efficient.
* Please comment with your experiences with your country's **Customs** and correct me if I'm wrong.

&nbsp;

## Before buying
* Use only reputed e-commerce sites like **AliExpress, Banggood, DealExtreme, etc**
* Use mobile apps for more discounts.
* Search for stuff and order by numbers sold.
Buy from sellers who have sold highest number of orders, taking cost into account.
* Chinese sellers are not very technically inclined, so don't expect them to answer all your technical doubts/queries.

&nbsp;

## While buying
* If possible, use only **(China) Govt. post registered air mail/parcel**.
This might take 30-45 days for delivery, but it's less likely to be held and charged by **Customs** than premium shippers like DHL or FedEx that typically deliver within a week.
* Tell the seller to declare stuff as **sample** or **replacement** part in the invoice, and declare only 10% of the price. See that amount declared is proportional to the size/volume of the shipment.
* Break down large quantities into smaller packages.
* Order only to residential addresses.
* Order not only to your house but also to your neighbours' as well as your friends' houses.
* As a rule of thumb, don't buy stuff that costs above $80-100. If it's flagged by **Customs**, you'll end up paying more than 1.5x of the price of the locally available alternative.

&nbsp;

## After buying
* Do not confirm delivery. Allow protection period to run out.
* Check the stuff for defects as soon as they arrive.
* Before filing disputes, contact the seller once to see if they are reasonable. Most of them will tell you to file disputes. If they don't, file disputes anyways.
* Be polite to sellers. They like to be addressed as *friend* or *brother/sister*. Keep wishing them on Chinese festivals. If they like you, they'll give you coupons and will also tell you about upcoming offers or new products.

 &nbsp;

## Buy locally
* When you don't want to wait a month or more.
* You have money to spend.
* If you don't mind buying from legal importers after shelling more money.
* If you don't think that corrupt politicians are milking your country more than you are.
* If you are worried about your country's trade deficit with China.
* Want to make your country great again. :P
