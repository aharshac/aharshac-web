# Project Overview

Learn how to build a responsive static website using Collaborizm as a **Content Management System**, leveraging your Collaborizm projects and profile posts.

The Collaborizm content is not fetched dynamically. Rather, it is pulled by a custom script and is built locally along with the rest of the website during development. Then, the build output is uploaded to the server.
Hence, the website is **static**.
In short, there are no XHR requests or *live* server-side code.
