# Project Overview
Problem in view ::
Special children walking issues due to a condition
Goals ::
 To build an opensource walker bot kit to resolve the Problem
Objective::
 Making a low budget  affordable and efficient walker bot 
Criteria for success:
 Iteration till achievement is deliverable
Assumption :: 
This WalkerBot will be a autonomous carrier enabling independence , and minimum dependency to users , while keeping the safety factors carefully manager . Bot will See will know where to go and what to avoid . 
Potential risks and obstacles.
1. In Case it is a patent design which is a big possibility . the design Rights will be given to the One who has already designed this Bot. And the ownership of this design will be the right of the Patent Holder. 
2. Useage risks . Every human has a unique behavior , in that case the setting of this WalkerBot can not be generalised , explicit settings will be required for each individual , in specific a child with cerebral Palsy(condition)
3. Fire Hazards. strong sensor fusion to monitor temperatures on all heat generating units With cut off system.
4. claims by users in case of an accident : : It is open source and 
5. Financial Obstacles.  Funding can be a big issue , but for prototyping
or making the first model , some compromise on the looks and the beauty of the Bot may be compromised by using Available crafted parts instead of Pro designed 3D printed Parts. 

# How To Receive Resume Credit
If you see a Bee Hive , it is made up in hexagon.cells which are hexagonally places around each other . and if you consider any hole as a center, the entire Bee Hive revolves around that very center. you may select any cell
but yet the entire Beehive will be around that.
Each member of this team
will be like the center of the team and around him will the team revolve
when that very member will be active with his inputs.
this is not   MY   project , this is   OUR   project and the ownership goes to the children Who will walk with this . The team members can claim this Are there personal project for what ever reason they want this experience to be recorded. they can use it in there CV or Blog Or website, can produce DIY kits, it is Open source design.
...describe what teammates must do to get credit...

# Teammates & Contributors I'm Looking For
People with Passion , knowing Maths , Programming , electricals , electronics
Fabrication experts , C A D  experts . && those who understand what is it like if Walking is not a possibility


# Where I Need the Most Help


1.Programming 
2. Programming microcontrollers
3. implementation of multiple P I D programs in sync
4.Open CV for visual recognition
5 A.I   

# Why Sponsor This Project?
The project Belongs to children , Sponsor will have a right to
1. Build DIY kits and sell them
2. Or contribute where ever he wants
3. Improve the design for use of adults
4. sponsor will get a full design specification of the product and the manufacturing unit.


# Why I'm Passionate About This Project
1. 1st step towards building a humanoid
2. WalkerBot for elderly and disabled due to age factor
3.WalkerBot for Special Adults
4.WalkerBot ..................n
