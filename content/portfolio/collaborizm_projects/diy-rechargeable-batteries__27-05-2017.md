# Project Overview
This project is a solution to problems all makers face while finding power sources for their Arduino, Raspberry Pi and other projects.

This project attempts to reuse and recycle rechargeable Lithium Ion (Li-ion) cells from batteries found in e-Waste like laptop batteries, mobile batteries, power banks and other similar sources.

Lithium batteries and Lithium mining, in general, are environmentally harmful processes. So they have to be recycled.

This project is an attempt to recycle and hence reduce the demand for new Lithium cells.

&nbsp;

# Methodology
The batteries used in consumer electronics are mostly grids of 18650 sized Li-ion cells with proprietary battery protection systems.

We will learn to extract these cells and use them with over-the-counter **Battery Management Systems** (BMS).

&nbsp;

# Alternative power sources for projects
1. **9V (6F22) batteries.**
Small, but don't supply enough current as capacity is low (~500. mAh) Also, not 12V.

2. **Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) batteries.**
Large, heavy, ugly and contain lead which is harmful to health and causes brain and kidney problems. These are mostly either 6V or 12V.

3. **Lithium Polymer (Lipo) batteries.**
Similar to Li-ion batteries, but differ in construction and typically provide large outputs in a short period of time.     
Prone to fire and explsion.
