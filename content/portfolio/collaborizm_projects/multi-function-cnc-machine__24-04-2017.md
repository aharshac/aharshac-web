# Backstory!

My friends and I had built a prototype for our Bachelor of Engineering final year project, at St. Joseph Engineering College, Mangalore. We were successful in implementing and testing Laser cutting and CNC drilling, but there wasn't enough time to add 3D printing without jeopardizing our other subjects.

# Prototype Iterations

## #1 **Micro Laser Cutter** (October 2014 - May 2015)
Completed in March 2015, titled "Micro Laser Cutter". Done using the motion mechanisms of two CD drives.

## #2 **MFC - The Prototype** (July 2015 - June 2016)
Most of the photos below were taken during the annual project exhibition in our college, where we were placed second!

#  The present state!
We donated the prototype to our juniors. We are impressed with the independent progress that they have made. In hindsight, it is a blessing in disguise as we can start afresh, with a better version.
&nbsp;

## Finished and learned so far:
* Experience of two years.
* Understanding of lectronics
* Custom firmware, with additional G-codes for multiple tools.
&nbsp;

## TODO:
* Design a marketable product.
* Find and select components.
* Keep manufacturing costs minimal.
&nbsp;


# Teammates & Contributors I'm Looking For
Anyone who is well versed with Manufacturing Processes, Rapid Prototyping, 3D Printing, Marketing, IPR, etc. If you think you can help, consider joining in.
&nbsp;

# Where we Need the Most Help
* Ideas, especially to implement IoT.
* Design
* Prototyping
* Capital and Investment
* Marketing
&nbsp;


# Why we are passionate about this project
We designed this product during the Third (junior) and Final (senior) years of our Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Mechanical Engineering course. We used all of our savings on the prototype.

Now, we can focus on making a new product, thanks to Collaborizm.

This project is dedicated to the Collaborizm founders, to our project guides and to the innovative spirit of the makers of the developing world. Our vision is to enable them with the right set of tools, at low prices.
