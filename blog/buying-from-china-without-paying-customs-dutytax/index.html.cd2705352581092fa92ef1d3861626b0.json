This is a small guide for buying stuff from the <strong>Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC)</strong>, not the <strong>Republic of China (Taiwan)</strong>.</p>\n<p>Donâ€™t buy locally from importers who donâ€™t provide legal invoices. They are actually buying stuff in small quantities from the above-mentioned sites without paying duties, yet charge you exorbitant profit margins. Theyâ€™re cheating you as well as your countryâ€™s government. Also, they will not cover warranties.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Context</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This guide is valid across the <strong>Indian subcontinent (South Asia), i.e., India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan</strong>.</li>\n<li>Not valid for countries like <strong>Brazil, Russia, etc.</strong> where the <strong>Customs</strong> departments are more efficient.</li>\n<li>Please comment with your experiences with your countryâ€™s <strong>Customs</strong> and correct me if Iâ€™m wrong.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Before buying</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Use only reputed e-commerce sites like <strong>AliExpress, Banggood, DealExtreme, etc</strong></li>\n<li>Use mobile apps for more discounts.</li>\n<li>Search for stuff and order by numbers sold.<br>\nBuy from sellers who have sold highest number of orders, taking cost into account.</li>\n<li>Chinese sellers are not very technically inclined, so donâ€™t expect them to answer all your technical doubts/queries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>While buying</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>If possible, use only <strong>(China) Govt. post registered air mail/parcel</strong>.<br>\nThis might take 30-45 days for delivery, but itâ€™s less likely to be held and charged by <strong>Customs</strong> than premium shippers like DHL or FedEx that typically deliver within a week.</li>\n<li>Tell the seller to declare stuff as <strong>sample</strong> or <strong>replacement</strong> part in the invoice, and declare only 10% of the price. See that amount declared is proportional to the size/volume of the shipment.</li>\n<li>Break down large quantities into smaller packages.</li>\n<li>Order only to residential addresses.</li>\n<li>Order not only to your house but also to your neighboursâ€™ as well as your friendsâ€™ houses.</li>\n<li>As a rule of thumb, donâ€™t buy stuff that costs above $80-100. If itâ€™s flagged by <strong>Customs</strong>, youâ€™ll end up paying more than 1.5x of the price of the locally available alternative.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>After buying</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not confirm delivery. Allow protection period to run out.</li>\n<li>Check the stuff for defects as soon as they arrive.</li>\n<li>Before filing disputes, contact the seller once to see if they are reasonable. Most of them will tell you to file disputes. If they donâ€™t, file disputes anyways.</li>\n<li>Be polite to sellers. They like to be addressed as <em>friend</em> or <em>brother/sister</em>. Keep wishing them on Chinese festivals. If they like you, theyâ€™ll give you coupons and will also tell you about upcoming offers or new products.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Buy locally</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When you donâ€™t want to wait a month or more.</li>\n<li>You have money to spend.</li>\n<li>If you donâ€™t mind buying from legal importers after shelling more money.</li>\n<li>If you donâ€™t think that corrupt politicians are milking your country more than you are.</li>\n<li>If you are worried about your countryâ€™s trade deficit with China.</li>\n<li>Want to make your country great again. ðŸ˜›</li>\n</ul>\n","__filename":"blog/collaborizm_posts/buying-from-china-without-paying__14-04-2017.md","__url":"/blog/buying-from-china-without-paying-customs-dutytax/","__resourceUrl":"/blog/buying-from-china-without-paying-customs-dutytax/index.html","__dataUrl":"/blog/buying-from-china-without-paying-customs-dutytax/index.html.cd2705352581092fa92ef1d3861626b0.json"}
